                   <p class="font-xs"><br> Carlos “Botong” Francisco, the poet of Angono, single-handedly revived the
                        forgotten art of mural and remained its most distinguished practitioner for nearly 
                        three decades. In panels such as those that grace the City Hall of Manila,
                        Francisco turned fragments of the historic past into vivid records of the legendary 
                        courage of the ancestors of his race. He was invariably linked with the “modernist” 
                        artists, forming with Victorio C. Edades and Galo Ocampo what was then known in the
                          local art circles as “The Triumvirate”. Botong’s unerring eye for composition, the 
                          lush tropical sense of color and abiding faith in the folk values typified by the
                           townspeople of Angono became the hallmark of his art.<br><br><br>

                    whose music evokes the folk elements of the Filipino heritage. Cousin to “Botong”

                    violin and piano, and songs for solo voice. He was the conductor of the much acclaimed

                    band, and the Banda Angono Numero Uno. His civic commitment and work with town bands

                    communities and opened a creative outlet for young Filipinos.<br>
